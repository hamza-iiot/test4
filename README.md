# **Advisory Group Feedback on PeerLink: Recommendations**

Based on the "Advisory Group Feedback on PeerLink" document, here is the detailed list of recommendations to work on, broken down by category.

## **1\. Platform Stability & Core Functions**

**Focus:** Addressing technical bugs and missing baseline features.

* Menu elements overlap on smaller screens (responsiveness issue).  
* Several links remain inactive.  
* Missing key functions such as “Reset Password”.  
* Form validation is incomplete on story submissions, with unclear or missing error messages.  
* Profile photo upload is not working.  
* Registration accepts unverified emails (no OTP validation) but still marks the profile as verified.

## **2\. Networking & Trust Layer**

**Focus:** Building credibility, connectivity, and peer learning across the SME community.

* Map SMEs with similar peers (by size, tech, domain) and show comparative stats.  
* Enable matchmaking between SMEs, vendors, consultants, and partners.  
* Conduct quizzes/surveys to identify community topics and challenges.  
* Turn shared challenges into webinars or virtual workshops (e.g., sandbox simulations, case study sessions).  
* Showcase profiles of the management, advisory team, and operational staff to build credibility.  
* Create a “Pioneer Journeys” section highlighting real SME transformation stories (detailing use cases, challenges, and results).  
* Add a member directory for collaboration and engagement.

## **3\. Interface & User Flow Enhancements**

**Focus:** Improving usability, navigation, and user engagement.

* Add Arabic language support.  
* Provide a user manual (using videos \+ screenshots).  
* Add an FAQ section.  
* Rename “Use Cases” to “Solutions” for a stronger value perception.  
* Redesign Solution Cards to have a quick-read structure and include filters (e.g., industry, process, payback).  
* On Solution pages, show the following upfront: “What changed,” “How it was done,” “Duration,” and “Next Action.” Also, include related threads inline.  
* Make the “Ask Question” feature modular, including a visible expert directory and tags by topic.  
* Refine the homepage headline to focus on Saudi SMEs and add clear calls to action (like “Find a solution” / “Ask a question”).  
* Simplify the dashboard, emphasizing active discussions and actionable items.

## **4\. Knowledge Assets & Interactivity**

**Focus:** Enhancing the quality and credibility of “Solutions” content.

* Add data source references and measurement context to content.  
* Include videos, interviews, and chatbots for interactivity.  
* Tag each solution with its implementation year and stage (e.g., PoC, Pilot, Full Deployment).  
* Improve the submission flow: keep the wizard format but add an autosave feature.

## **5\. Community Activation & Retention**

**Focus:** Encouraging ongoing contribution and participation.

* Incentivize SMEs to share solutions beyond just PR value (e.g., recognition, learning badges, feature highlights).  
* Create status tiers or benefit clubs for active contributors and recognized members.
